     * Terminology!
     * 
     * A class is the overall definition, like a blueprint.
     * An instance is a specific object made according to that definition.
     * We use "instance" and "object" to mean the same thing.
     * 
     * For example, if there is a Person class, we can make an instance of a specific person: Auberon.
     * 
     * There can be many instances for the same class. For example: Auberon, Xinting, Baya are all
     * different instances of the Person class.
     * 
     * Each instance has its own instance variables: Auberon's age can be different from Baya's age.
